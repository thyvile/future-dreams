# FUTURE DREAMS preview

Open `reality.html` directly in your browser (or your sandbox preview) to explore FUTURE DREAMS—no build or server required.

If you prefer to use a local server, any static host works, for example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/reality.html` (or the forwarded port URL your environment provides).
