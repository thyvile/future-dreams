# FUTURE DREAMS preview

You can view `reality.html` directly from this environment without installing anything locally.

## Quick start

```bash
./serve.sh 8000
```

The script binds to `0.0.0.0` so it works in remote sandboxes. After running it, open the printed URL:

- In GitHub Codespaces: the URL will look like `https://<codespace>-8000.app.github.dev/reality.html`.
- In other hosted sandboxes (including Codex): forward or expose the printed port and open `http://0.0.0.0:<port>/reality.html` through your preview feature.
- Locally: use `http://localhost:8000/reality.html`.

Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when you're done.
